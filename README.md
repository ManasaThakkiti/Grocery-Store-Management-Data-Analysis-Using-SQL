📌 Grocery Store Management System – SQL Data Analysis Project

📖 Project Overview

This project focuses on building and analyzing a complete Grocery Store Management System using SQL.
It covers products, customers, orders, suppliers, employees, inventory, and sales performance.

The goal of this project is to understand how SQL can be used to manage and analyze grocery store operations, and how insights from data can support better business decisions.

🗂️ Database Structure

The system contains 6 core tables:

Products – product name, price, category, stock

Customers – customer details

Orders – order transactions

OrderDetails – quantity & total amount

Suppliers – supplier information

Employees – staff handling orders

An ER Diagram was created to visualize relationships between tables.
